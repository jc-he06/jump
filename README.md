Tips:

-- Prize and Score:

- The score is the numbers of coins you collect.

- If you jump beneath the blue box, which the prize box, and hit the bottom of it, you will trigger the prize box and get a chance to take the biggify apple.  Once you take the apple, Character will get bigger size.

-- Condition to lose the game:
- Contact with the spike.

- Contact with the ghost.

- Jump out of the platform (or fall off the platform).

-- Other:
- You can elimate ghosts by jumping above them and hitting their heads.   Meanwhile, you can also get extra bounce for doing that. (Just like the way we play in 'Super Mario Bros').
